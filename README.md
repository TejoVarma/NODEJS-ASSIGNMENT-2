NodeJS Assignment-2


Background
In Nodejs, there are 3 different ways to take input.
1. Command line arguments
2. Environment variables
3. readLine function


In this assignment, you will practice how to take input in these ways. We will take a name as
input (e.g. Ravi) and print Hello Ravi.

a greeting Hello Ravi

2. readEnvVariable.js
a. This file should read a name (e.g. Ravi) through an environment variable called
USERNAME and print a greeting Hello Ravi

3. readFromLine.js
a. This file should read a name (e.g. Ravi) from the user and print a greeting
Hello Ravi
